What can be my daily Greek lesson routine?

1. 1 lesson on DuoLingo.
2. 1 lesson on GreekPod101.
3. Watch 1 video of [Super Easy Greek](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtosLU-ycG4&list=PLA5UIoabheFNO4VVJO7qL5lu7kJofgu5s).

Estimated time:

1. 15 min
2. 15 min
3. 30 min

Reading idea: Find a reasonably popular non-fiction book that you'd like to read - chances are it may have a greek translation.
